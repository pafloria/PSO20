### ABSTRACT
Particle Swarm Optimisation is a heuristic differential-free algorithm originating in bioinformatics. A common problem in academia is to efficiently find global optima of functions. A novel parallel implementation of the algorithm is proposed in this report. We executed the code on the Euler VI supercomputing cluster of ETH Zurich. The main finding is that a sufficient speed-up is achieved compared to the sequential version. A notable scaling for computationally more expensive functions was attained.
